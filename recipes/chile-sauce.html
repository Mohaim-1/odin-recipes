    <li><h3>Make the chile sauce</h3></li>
    <ol>
      <li>In a dry skillet, lightly toast dried chiles until they develop a pleasant aroma<br>
        <i>Do not burn them--they'll go bitter! If you think you burned them, throw them away and try again or skip this step.</i></li>
      <li>Stem and optionally seed chiles</li>
      <ul>
        <li>4 dried guajillo chiles</li>
        <li>2 dried ancho chiles</li>
        <li>1 dried Ã¡rbol chile</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Reconstitute chiles</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Place chiles in a small pot</li>
        <li>Add optional ingredients</li>
        <ul>
          <li>2&ndash;3 tbsp cumin seeds</li>
          <li>1&ndash;2 tbsp mexican oregano</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Barely cover with water and bring to a boil<br>
          <i>The more water you use, the more of the chile flavor will go down the drain with any of it you can't use.</i></li>
        <li>Turn off heat, cover, and let stand for 15 minutes</li>
      </ol>
      <li>To a blender, add and blend the following into a moderately thick sauce:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Reconstituted chiles</li>
        <li>Optionally 1 chipotle in adobo</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of the soaking liquid to start, more if needed to help it blend or to thin the sauce</li>
      </ul>
      You could also finely mince the chiles with a knife or mash them in a mortar and pestle.
