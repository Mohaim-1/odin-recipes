    <p>A thick, flavorful, spicy Mexican-style red chile sauce useful for lots of Mexican-themed dishes. Freezes very well.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>5 dried guajillo chiles</li>
      <li>3 dried ancho chiles</li>
      <li>2 dried Ã¡rbol chile</li>
      <li>Water to cover</li>
      <li>1 chipotle in adobo</li>
      <li>2&ndash;3 tbsp cumin seeds</li>
      <li>1&ndash;2 tbsp Mexican oregano</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a dry skillet, lightly toast dried chiles until they develop a pleasant aroma<br>
        <i>Do not burn them--they'll go bitter! If you think you burned them, throw them away and try again or skip this step.</i></li>
      <li>Stem and optionally seed chiles</li>
      <li>Reconstitute chiles</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Place dried chiles, cumin seeds, and mexican oregano to a small pot from the pot</li>
        <li>Barely cover with water.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Turn off heat, cover, and let stand for at least 15 minutes</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Add the solids, the chipole, and 1/4 cup of the soaking liquid to a blender.</li>
      <li>Add more liquid as needed to help it blend and come together to a medium-thick sauce.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>You could also finely mince the chiles with a knife or mash them in a mortar and pestle.</li>
        <li>Reserve any remaining soaking liquid if you think you could use it elsewhere. For example, if you're
           using the chile sauce to make a stew, just add the liquid to the stock. Don't throw away flavor!</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Wipe out any remaining solids from the pot.</li>
      <li>Add the sauce back to the pot and simmer for at least 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>It's done! Use immediately or freeze it for later.</li>
    </ol>
