    <ol>
      <li><h3>Make the veggie stock</h3></li>
      <p>Follow this recipe: <a href="savory-vegan-stock.html">Savory Vegan Soup Stock</a></p>
      <li><h3>Make the chile sauce</h3></li>
      <ol>
        <li>In a dry skillet, lightly toast dried chiles until they develop a pleasant aroma<br>
          <i>Do not burn them--they'll go bitter! If you think you burned them, throw them away and try again or skip this step.</i></li>
        <li>Stem and optionally seed chiles</li>
        <ul>
          <li>4 dried guajillo chiles</li>
          <li>2 dried ancho chiles</li>
          <li>1 dried árbol chile</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Reconstitute chiles</li>
        <ol>
          <li>Place chiles in a small pot</li>
          <li>Add optional ingredients</li>
          <ul>
            <li>2&ndash;3 tbsp cumin seeds</li>
            <li>1&ndash;2 tbsp mexican oregano</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Barely cover with water and bring to a boil<br>
            <i>The more water you use, the more of the chile flavor will go down the drain with any of it you can't use.</i></li>
          <li>Turn off heat, cover, and let stand for 15 minutes</li>
        </ol>
        <li>To a blender, add and blend the following into a moderately thick sauce:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Reconstituted chiles</li>
          <li>Optionally 1 chipotle in adobo</li>
          <li>1/4 cup of the soaking liquid to start, more if needed to help it blend or to thin the sauce</li>
        </ul>
        You could also finely mince the chiles with a knife or mash them in a mortar and pestle.
      </ol>
      <li><h3>Cut up the veggies you're adding to the stew</h3></li>
      <ul>
        <li>1 medium-large onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 head of garlic, crushed and minced</li>
        <li>1&ndash;2 jalapeños, serranos, or other spicy chiles, sliced or minced</li>
        <li>1&ndash;2 poblanos, diced</li>
        <li>1&ndash;2 red bell peppers, cut into 1.5-inch strips</li>
        <li>6 red potatoes, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>3 carrots, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>3 ribs of celery, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1/2 head of cabbage or 1 bunch of kale (it's actually really good if it's cooked--stop treating it like it's lettuce!)</li>
      </ul>
      <li><h3>Brown the chicken thighs</h3></li>
      <ol>
        <li>Wash the pot that was used for the stock and thoroughly dry the inside.</li>
        <li>If any small amount of water remains, pre-heat the pot on the stove without oil for a minute or so until all the remaining water has boiled off.</li>
        <li>Pat chicken thighs dry with paper towels, which helps with browning.</li>
        <li>Add 4 tbsp. neutral cooking oil to the pot and preheat on stove over medium high.</li>
        <li>Working in batches, brown the chicken.<br>
          <i>Overcrowding the pan interferes with browning and won't actually save much time. If you want to save time only brown some of the chicken.</i></li>
        <ol>
          <li>Carefully add the chicken to pot.</li>
          <li>Cover pot with a splatter guard (not a solid lid) if you have one (if you don't have one, get one).</li>
          <li>Cook the chicken until it's deep golden brown on the bottom.</li>
          <li>Flip and repeat for the other side.</li>
          <li>Remove from pot and set aside.</li>
        </ol>
      </ol>
      <li><h3>Make the stew</h3></li>
      <ol>
        <li>Add the diced onion to the pot you browned the chicken in previously.</li>
        <li>Add a medium pinch of salt to help the onions release their moisture.</li>
        <li>Cook the onions until barely translucent, using them to deglaze any stuck on chicken.</li>
        <li>Add garlic and spicy chiles (jalapeños or serranos or whatever you chose).</li>
        <li>Cook for 2&ndash;3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add to the stew:
        <ul>
          <li>Veggie stock</li>
          <li>Chile sauce</li>
          <li>Potatoes</li>
          <li>Chicken</li>
          <li>Any chicken juices from the plate the chicken was on.</li>
          <li>Salt to taste (2+ heavy pinches)</li>
          <li>2&ndash;4 bay leaves</li>
          <li>2&ndash;3 tbsp cumin powder (if you didn't add cumin seeds to the chile sauce)</li>
          <li>1&ndash;3 tsbp smoked paprika</li>
          <li>2&ndash;3 tsp cayenne powder</li>
          <li>1&ndash;2 tbsp Mexican oregano (if you didn't add it to the chile sauce)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Bring stew to a medium simmer.</li>
        <li>Simmer until chicken is cooked (175-190 &deg;F), 20&ndash;40 minutes.</li>
        <li>If there's a lot of fat sitting on the surface, skim some of it off with a metal spoon and reserve (you may decide to add it back).</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken pieces from the stew, let them sit and cool for a few minutes, shred them off the bone with two forks, then set aside.</li>
        <li>Add the cabbage (if using), carrots, celery, kale stems, and pobanos to the stew. Continue cooking the stew until the potatoes are almost fork-tender.</li>
        <li>Add two cans of undrained black or white beans to the stew.</li>
        <li>Reintroduce the shredded chicken to the pot.</li>
        <li>Adjust for seasoning.</li>
        <li>Add the red bell peppers to the pot. Cook for 2&ndash;5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Lower the heat to low.</li>
        <li>Add the kale leaves (if using). Once its all in the pot (it'll fit, promise), turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>Adjust for seasoning.</li>
        <li>Let it rest for at least 5 minutes.</li>
      </ol>
      <li><h3>Serve</h3>
      <p>Serve with some white rice and a slice of lime.</p></li>
    </ol>
